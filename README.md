# ValidateRequestsDemo
You must write an HTTP service that - receives requests generated by our collector - check the validity of each request - reject invalid requests - count and store statistics per customer per hour - use stub function for valid requests

Currently Authentication is disabled and 
H2 Embedded DB is used
